##Command Line Challenge

I had issues configuring my ssh keys to actually work with sftp but ive been able to finally do that.

I was able to run the sftp vagrant@localhost command over my VM 
Then i navigated to the local directory of my shared Vagrant folder being the command-line-for-the-win folder where i wanted to upload the tasks.

Then i used the put command with the filepaths to the screenshots to upload them.

Now i've pushed them to my github repository and i hope you would give me a favorable review
